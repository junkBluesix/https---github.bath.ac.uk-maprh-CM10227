%% LaTeX exam macro style, B.W.Silverman, 25.02.92
%% --later hacked by F.E Burstall, 26/2/92,27/2/92,28/2/92,29/11/93,10/2/95
%%  2/11/95 and now I shall try and keep a proper changelog:
%%  29/11/95  ---FEB:added rubric for midsessionals and added punctuation
%%            to \calculatortext
%%  07/05/96  ---FEB:fixed up the test for starting a long question on an
%%            odd numbered page: this was completely broken.
%%  06/11/96  ---FEB: added this years crop of new rubrics and
%%            cleared out the old ones.
%%  07/11/96  ---FEB: removed the setting of \footheight: it is never
%%            used and latex2e does not define it!  These macros now
%%            work under latex2e (hoorah!)
%%  12/11/96  ---FEB: made \stage a no-op so as not to break old
%%            papers too much.
%%  04/02/97  ---FEB: added rubric for C2 (which I missed in
%%            November)
%%  22/09/97  ---FEB: made many changes for modularised system since
%%  most papers now contain a single section.  Thus:
%%            (a) usually \examsetup now called by \examcode rather
%%            than the user and this provides default page
%%            and question numbering: unless \maketitle is present,
%%            page-numbering starts at 2 and questions at 1.
%%            (b) installed new rubrics and caused the old ones to
%%            complain.
%%            (c) We have facultised (?) and are no longer a school
%%            but a department.  Appropriate changes to macros names
%%            made.
%%            (d) Introduced a \sections macro (which I may not
%%            document) so that \sections{three}, say, adds some text
%%            to the rubric about handing in the answers to the three
%%            sections separately.
%%            (e) Moved the \marks macro from exam.cls so users of
%%            latex209 syntax can access it.
%%  24/09/97  ---FEB: made \date accept \\ following a suggestion of
%%  AFS.  I don't think I'll document this---just let it be a nice surprise!
%%  15/10/97  ---FEB: made a default rubric for people who use
%%  \maketitle before they set \papertype (such people exist and were
%%  getting an error!)
%%  30/10/01  ---FEB: added new rubric for MSc units
%%  02/09/02  ---FEB: changed MSc unit rubric
%%  09/09/02  ---FEB: changed MSc unit rubric yet again
%%  23/10/03  ---FEB: new rubrics for all exams
%%  30/11/05  ---FEB: rubric changed for year 3/4 and year 5 (which
%%  should be obsolete now.)
%%  17/07/06  ---FEB: make \maketitle a no-op after it has been used once.
%%  07/12/06  ---FEB: this last was a bad idea.  It breaks cover-page
%%  manufacture
%%  07/03/05  ---FEB: \mklibmaketitle for use when generating library
%%  copies 
%%  13/10/11  ---FEB: turn off front-pages: these are done by Faculty
%%  now.
%%  31/10/11  ---FEB: turned front-pages back on.  Faculty needs to
%%  decide how this will be done.
%%  21/11/13  ---FEB: turned front-pages off again.  Too much
%%  confusion!
%%  20/02/14  ---FEB: changed headers and footers to meet new
%%  university guidelines, fatuously stupid though they are.

%%
%% questionbreak macro: we want to discourage page breaks in the
%% middle of a question.  However, experience shows that some users
%% (especially those in Statistics) are hopelessly addicted to long
%% questions so we must force them to 
%% (a) break pages in a controlled manner, warning the student what
%% is going on.
%% (b) discourage them from starting such a question on an odd
%% numbered page by issuing a warning.
%%
%% Part (b) actually needs a certain amount of thought (I got it
%% wrong first time) since we only reliably know the page number at
%% \shipout time.  This means we must issue the warning at \shipout
%% time which is often much later than when the question is broken...
%%
%% We begin by collecting some ingredients:
%% 1. test for how many pages a question extends over
\newif\iffirstpage
%% 2. penalties for page breaks
\mathchardef\warningpenalty=9999
\mathchardef\nowarningpenalty=10000
\def\newpagepenalty{\nowarningpenalty}
%% 3. Redefine \newpage so it can carry information (via penalties)
%% to the output routines
\def\newpage{\par\vfil\penalty-\newpagepenalty}
\let\qnewpage\newpage
%% 4. The warning: 
\def\longqwarning{%
\typeout{}
\typeout{************************************************************}
\typeout{************************************************************}
\typeout{WARNING!!!  You have started a long exam question on page \thepage.}
\typeout{This is an odd-numbered page!  }
\typeout{}
\typeout{----------ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO DO THIS?-----------------}
\typeout{************************************************************}
\typeout{************************************************************}
\typeout{}}
%% 5. We now subvert the output routine
\output{\let\par\@@par
  \ifnum\outputpenalty =-\warningpenalty\ifodd\count0\longqwarning\fi\fi
  \ifnum\outputpenalty <-\@M\@specialoutput\else
  \@makecol\@opcol\@floatplacement\@startcolumn

  \global\vsize\ifnum\outputpenalty >-\@Miv \@colroom
                  \else \maxdimen\fi}
%% 6. Finally the entry point into the whole damn shooting match:
%% \questionbreak adds suitable text to a mid-question page break and
%% sets the penalties so that the output routine knows we are on the
%% first page of a question if necessary.

%%  pagestyle definition
%%
\input{fancyheadings.sty}% get header macros
\usepackage{lastpage}
\setlength{\headrulewidth}{0pt}
%% Now we do the deed: we want to define both plain and fancy
%% headers: we want plain on pages 1 and 2 (the title page and the
%% first page of the exam) and fancy elsewhere.  Moreover, the plain
%% headers must be different on pages 1 and 2.  Luckily, we can give
%% different headers for odd and even pages. (This is why we are
%% printing two sided.)
%%
%% The left header is blank.
\lhead{\fancyplain{}{}}
%% The right header has \topcode on page 1 and is blank thereafter
\rhead{\fancyplain{}{}}
%% The centre header is blank
\chead{\fancyplain{}{}}
%% The right footer gives \examcodetext
\rfoot{\fancyplain{\examcodetext}{\examcodetext}}
%% the centre footer has "Page N of M"
\cfoot[Page \thepage\ of \pageref{LastPage}]{\fancyplain{Page \thepage\ of \pageref{LastPage}}{Page \thepage\ of \pageref{LastPage}}}
\pagestyle{fancyplain}
%%
%% All this needs to be initialised.  The \examsetup macro does this:
%%
\def\theexamcode{}
\def\examcodetext{}
\def\examctdtext{}
% get page number, question number and examcode--and use this to set 
% page style plain on pages one and two else fancy.  If the exam code
% is not empty we define appropriate stuff for the headers and
% footers using it.
\newcommand{\examsetup}[3]{\setcounter{page}{#1}
\ifnum\thepage<3\thispagestyle{plain}\else\thispagestyle{fancy}\fi
\setcounter{qnum}{#2}\def\theexamcode{#3}
\ifx\theexamcode\empty\else\def\examcodetext{\theexamcode}
\def\examctdtext{\theexamcode}\fi}
% the default behaviour is to start at page 2 with question 1:
\newcommand{\examcode}[1]{\examsetup{2}{1}{#1}}
%
%  Set up a default:

%
%  paperend macro
%
\newcommand{\paperend}[1]{\lfoot{#1}\rfoot{\examcodetext}}
%

%% Now for macros to produce the front page of the exam
%% 
%% The user must tell us several things:
%% 1.  The title of the exam.  This is done with \title.
%% 2.  The date of the exam.  This is done with \date.
%% 3.  Whether calculators are to be used.  This is done in the
%% preamble by declaring \calculators or \nocalculators--at least for
%% exams for the Dept of Mathematics.
%% 4.  What kind of rubric is required.  A variety of rubrics have
%% been defined as macros of the form \foorubric and the correct one
%% is selected by saying \papertype{foo}.  Thus it is easy (and
%% doubtless will be necessary) to add new rubrics as our
%% examinations procedure gets more and more arcane.
%%
%% Also, we provide \specialrubric which sets up a user defined
%% rubric built with the \rubric macro.
%% 
%% Finally, when exams for other Depts are being prepared, not only
%% do we need a special rubric but we must also provide the list of
%% degrees for which this paper examines candidates, any blurb and
%% year/part of degree and also the Dept's exam code.  \degree, \blurb and
%% \deptcode provide this. 

%% First the title:
\def\title#1{\gdef\thetitle{#1}}

%% The blurb, if necessary
\def\theblurb{\mbox{}}
\def\blurb#1{\gdef\theblurb{#1}}
%% The date:
\def\thedate{}
\def\date#1{\gdef\thedate{#1}}
%% This will be between two \hrules on the page so we need its width.
%% We reserve a box for the date:
\newbox\datebox\newdimen\datewidth\newdimen\daterulewidth
%% Test for whether we want calculators or not
\newif\ifcalculators
%% Default is no calculators
\calculatorsfalse 
\def\calculators{\calculatorstrue}
\def\nocalculators{\calculatorsfalse}
%% This text goes into the rubric
\def\calculatortext{\ifcalculators Candidates may use
university-supplied calculators.\else No calculators may be brought in
and used.\fi}
%% If the exam is split into sections, we add a ``please hand in
%% separate sections separately'' tag to the rubric.  We need to know
%% how many sections there are so...
\def\sectiontext{}
\newcommand{\sections}[1]{\gdef\sectiontext{%
\\\bigskip Answers to the #1 sections must be handed in separately.}}

%% Little macro for 1/2 (as in 1 1/2 hour exam)
\def\@half{\frac{1}{2}} %Got burnt almost as soon as original
                        %version got released--other users like to
                        %define \half!!

%% Give user a chance to define a rubric:
\def\myrubric{}
\long\def\rubric#1{\gdef\myrubric{#1}}

%% We find out what type of rubric is required.  If the chosen
%% rubric is not known to us, we put in a default one which
%% complains!

\def\papertype#1{\expandafter\ifx\csname#1rubric\endcsname\relax\gdef\therubric{\unknownrubric}\else\gdef\therubric{\csname#1rubric\endcsname}\fi}

%% We also provide a default (which reminds the punters to insert it
%% sooner or later):
\def\therubric{\defaultrubric}
%% The list of degrees or just a header: at present, we do not give
%% the list of degrees because there are too damn many of them!
%% However, for service courses, this information must be provided so this
%% can be changed by the user if necessary.
\def\thedegree{%
\large\bf DEPARTMENT OF MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES\\
EXAMINATION}
\def\degree#1{\gdef\thedegree{#1}}

%% The exam code for the paper.  By default, this is just \theexamcode
%% unless reset by \deptcode
\def\topcode{\theexamcode}
\def\deptcode#1{\gdef\topcode{#1}}

%% Now we do the deed and create the title page
%%
%% We set the date in a tabular so it will accept \\ and wrap this in
%% a box so we can calculate the width of the lines above and below
\def\maketitle{\thispagestyle{plain}\setcounter{page}{1}%
