Advantages of high level programming languages
- easier to write
- easier to read
- easier to correct
- easier to port/modify

2 ways for high level languages to be converted to machine specific instructions
- interpret
- compile

What is a statement in a programming language? What is an expression
statement is smallest standalone element of a programming language which expresses some action to be carried our
expression is a combination of constants variables, operators and functions that produces another value

Rules of precedence in Java when calculating mathematical expressions
PMDAS

Define a method in the Java programming language 
named sequence of statements that performs a desired operation

What is the difference between an argument and a parameter
- parameter is what appears in the definition of a method
- a argument is the instance passed at runtime
give an example of each

Difference between statically typed language and dynamically typed language
Static - langs which fix types at compile time
Dynamic - lang in which types are discovered at execution time

Difference between strongly typed language and weakly type
Strongly - types are always enforced
Weakly - language in which types may be ignored (opposite of strongly)

Define Java in each case
Strong, Static

if/then/else

(return statements from every branch)

Define a recursive method. 
- method that calls itself

Define the recursive problem size

What are the advantages to defining a block of code within a method
- can attach a name 
- make program easier to read
- isolate the method code from the rest of the program.
- debug once
- re-use within program
- export to other programs

iteration/loops
while
do while

flow of execution of a while loop
evaluate condition (true/false)
if false, exit and continue with next statement
if true execute all statements in body and go back to evaluate

Encapsulation/Generalisation

Describe a way to find the length of of a string in Java
String.length()
(Or index of last character = -1)

Describe the difference between an immutable data type and a mutable data type. 
- Immutable: data types whose contents cannot be modified after creation
- Mutable: data types whose contents can be modified after creation

What are key differences between the ways in which elements are added to and removed from from Lists (ArrayLists), Queues and Stacks?
- List can access element in any position using index (random access)
- Queue adds elements at the end and removes elements from the beginning (FIFO)
- Stacks add to and remove from the top (FILO)

Define two types of method that might be found in a Java class. Give an example of each one 
Mutators - methods which change the state of a class
Accessors - methods which inform the outside world (people or code) about that state
Constructors (1) - have similar form  but are not methods

Define Modularisation (2 of 4)
Process of defining a whole into well defined parts which can be built and examined separately and interact in well defined ways

What is the difference between class and object diagrams
- show classes of an application and relationships between them
- give information about the source code
- static view of the program

Is Java an entirely object oriented language? Why / Why not?
- No
- primitives are not objects (not subclasses of the Class Object)

What is the difference between an alias and a copy
alias is a second variable that contains a reference to an object that already has a name
copy is a duplicate set of data identical to that which is already held in another object or referred to by another variable

What does a Wrapper class do with respect to a Java primitive?
- holds the value of the primitive within an object (i.e. within an instance of a class that is a subclass of Object)

How could you use overloading to define multiple constructors within a Java class
- create more than one version of the constructor each of which takes different parameters

Name two destinations for a Java print statement. What might you print to each one?
System (or Standard) out: Used for writing the anticiapted output of a program
System (or Standard) error: Used for writing error messages

Name the three parts of a well-written response to a thrown error in Java
try block
catch block
finally block

What is a key-value pair? Where might you find one?
A key value pair is a combination of a reference object and referenced object in a non-indexed data structure such as a dictionary

What is casting? How do you achieve it in Java
Casting is the process of specifying a data type (alternatively, preventing type loss) by writing the name of the class being cast in brackets before a variable name

How might a dictionary (or, in Java, a HashMap) be used to speed up the execution of a method containing many repetitions of the same step (e.g. a recursive method)? Give an example
- as a place to store 'hints' i.e. the result of that repeated method after the first execution
- e.g. you might use a dictionary to store the results of the lower fibonnaci numbers when calculating a larger fibonacci number

What is the difference between a pure function and a modifier
- modifiers make changes to the state of the objects passed to them (have side effects)
- pure functions do not

What is inheritance? Which keyword is used to achieve it in Java
- the passing of common attributes (fields and methods) from a auperclass to a subcalss
- the extends keyword

In Jave, how might you call the constructor of a superclass from within a subclass?
- by using the super keyword

What are the benefits (if any) of inheritance?
- allows the definition of classes as extension of other classes
- avoid code duplication
- enable code re-use
- facilitate code maintenance
- improve code extensibility
- enables substitution (1/2 marks for defining but not using the term)

What is a polymorphic variable. Which variables (or fields) are polymorphic in Java
- Variables that can hold objects of more than one type
- all of them

What is the difference between a static type and a dynamic type?
- Declared type of a variable is its static type
- the type of the object a variable refers to is its dynamic type

What is the scope of a variable in Java if it is declared as Public? Private? Protected?
Public: visible from anywhere
Private: visible only to objects of the same class
Protected: visible to objects of the same class and/or subtypes of that class

What are the key characteristics of an abstract class in Java
- have abstract in the signature
- cannot be instantiated
- concrete classes complete the implementation
- contain at least one abstract method
- abstract methods have no body

How are the inheritance rules different for Interfaces and Superclasses in Java?
- subclasses can inherit from multiple interfaces
- but only one superclass

What makes two classes tightly coupled. Is tight or loose coupling more desirable? Why 
- If each depends closely on many details of the other
- loose coupling is more desirable
- makes modifying code easier and less error prone

What is high cohesion. Is high or low cohesion more desirable? Why
- a characteristic of a unit of code that is responsible for just one logical task
- high cohesion is more desirable
- High cohesion
+ makes it easier to understand what a class or method does
+ facilitates re-use
+ facilitates the attachement of a descriptive and meaningful name to cohesive code
