\title{CM 10227: Help For Coursework 2 (DoD)}
\author{Dr. Rachid Hourizi and Dr. Michael Wright}
\date{\today}
\frame{\titlepage}

\begin{frame}
\begin{itemize}
\item These slides should help you to complete Coursework 2 (DoD)
\item They will provide information about \textbf{one} approach that can be used to complete the coursework (There are others)
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\begin{itemize}
\item In some places, we provide small snippets of code that you may wish to include in your coursework 
\item We have, however, deliberately avoided providing so much code that Coursework 2 becomes trival
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\begin{itemize}
\item In the best case, therefore, these slides will help you to \textbf{get started} with Coursework 2 
\item If you find that you are still stuck after seeing them, please ask for further help via the programming1 mailing list, in the labs/drop-ins/PAL sessions or directly from Rachid/Michael
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{FAQs}
\begin{itemize}
\item How should we start using the 4 classes provided?
\item How can we track both HumanPlayer position and BotPlayer position in a Map object?
\item which method(s), should we use to support HELLO, PICKUP, MOVE, LOOK AND QUIT commands from both HumanPlayer and BotPlayer?
\item How can we get more help
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\begin{itemize}
\item How should we start using the 4 classes provided?
\begin{itemize}
\item You only need one instance each of HumanPlayer, BotPlayer, GameLogic and Map
\item i.e. one HumanPlayer Object, one BotPlayer Object, one GameLogic Object and one Map Object
\item The HumanPlayer and BotPlayer should be able to see \textbf{the same} GameLogic object (but not the Map)
\item The GameLogic Object (and only the GameLogic Object) shold have direct access to the Map
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
